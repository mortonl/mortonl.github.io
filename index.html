    <strong>Driving DevSecFinOps practices</strong>, embedding security, cost-awareness, and operational excellence into
    our delivery lifecycle.
  </li>

    <strong>Supporting squads with architectural guidance</strong>, from incident resolution to long-term platform
    evolution.

    <strong>Architectural foresight</strong>: Maintaining and evolving low level designs of long-standing, partially
    implemented, and anticipated projects.
