<h2>üöÄ Strategic Impact & Leadership</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Organizational Transformation:</strong> Championed and architecturally led DevEx modernisation initiatives
    across 260+ engineering professionals across the UK, Eastern Europe and Vietnam aligning practices, tools, and
    platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Technical Strategy & Architectural Foresight:</strong> Designed enterprise-scale, horizontally scalable
      architectures using APIs, microservices, and modular data stores. My holistic design approach draws on deep
      business insight to anticipate future needs and produce architecture that is an enabler to advancing business
      desires not a blocker or bottleneck.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        A prime example is the product catalogue and order fulfillment system I architected for Evri. It formed the
        foundation of the Evri Websites Send and Return Flows and enabled later projects‚Äîfrom the Post Office reseller
        initiative to the in-house international C2C services‚Äîby each time reusing and evolving components such as the
        product catalogue, quoting and ordering services. This modular forward-thinking architecture meant only minimal
        changes were required with each iteration and saved ~18 months of development effort overall.</i

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Developer Experience & Enablement:</strong> Mentored engineers and architects, introduced governance
    frameworks, and established best practices to elevate code quality and consistency across teams.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Operational Cost Optimization:</strong> Used DevSecFinOps practices identifying potential operational cost
    reductions approaching $500k a year, furthermore I designed and delivered decommissioning of legacy or duplicated
    services achieving a significant amount of realised savings so far this year.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security & Quality Culture:</strong> Made SBOMs and tools like Dependency Track standard practice, and
    instituted automated quality gates to immeasurably improve and ensure the robust, secure, and ways-of-working
    aligned software delivery across the organisation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>AI-First Leadership:</strong> Championed an AI-first approach for all tasks, using AI tools to rapidly
    deliver initial versions of documentation, governance, and implementations before refining as needed. Pioneered
    prompt libraries as a cost-effective alternative to RPA for lightweight repetitive tasks and as an self-serve
    solution for less technical users within the Copilot Champions community, demonstrating that AI augments rather than
    replaces human expertise.
  </li>
</ul>
