## Architectural Philosophy & Practices

### 🧠 Strategic Thinking & Architectural Stewardship
- **Architectural foresight**: I maintain and evolve a backlog of long-standing, partially implemented, and anticipated LLDs.
- **Resurrecting valuable proposals**: I identify and revive past architectural ideas that still hold value.
- **ADR creation and documentation**: I help document architectural decisions (e.g., database choices) to support transparency and future-proofing.

### 🛠️ Operational Excellence
- **Drift detection and remediation**: I implement automated checks and enforcement for infrastructure drift.
- **Component deprecation processes**: I define and pilot structured approaches to safely retire outdated components.
- **Weekly maintenance automation**: I proactively schedule and rotate maintenance tasks to ensure system hygiene.

### 🔐 Security & Compliance
- **PCI DSS compliance**: I ensure critical vulnerabilities are addressed within SLA, especially for payment-related systems.
- **DevSecOps mindset**: I embed security into architecture and delivery, aligning with confidentiality, integrity, and availability principles.

### 📚 Knowledge Management & Enablement
- **Onboarding and documentation**: I contribute to onboarding guides, architectural standards, and documentation strategies.
- **Backstage improvements**: I enhance internal developer portals and metadata syncs to improve discoverability and governance.

### 🧩 Systems Thinking & Governance
- **Tech debt triage and hygiene**: I help define what constitutes tech debt, advocate for its visibility, and align remediation with strategic goals.
- **Architecture board processes**: I contribute to the governance of architectural decisions and traceability of requirements.
