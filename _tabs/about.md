### How I Got Here

I originally wanted to design and build video games—it sounded fun! But after seeing the lack of jobs in that industry, I switched to general software roles after my degree. Since then, I’ve advanced through several companies and roles to where I am now, focusing on architecture and technical leadership.

## Travel & Perspective

Travel has taught me that England and America aren’t the most advanced countries, despite what some might believe. The world is big and also tiny. Visiting places like Hong Kong’s airport (built on a reclaimed island) and their high-speed trains showed me what’s possible when countries invest in infrastructure. We’ve stagnated in many ways; travel is the best education you can get.

## Outside of Work

I love spending time with my wife and two boys, playing video games, and tackling carpentry and DIY projects (like remodelling our upstairs layout).

## Community & Advice

I’m active in the open source community (see my [GitHub](https://github.com/mortonl)).

My advice: **Remain skeptical but still try to drive improvement—don’t become part of the problem.**
