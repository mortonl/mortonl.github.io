# About Me

Welcome! I’m Luke Morton, a Senior Technical Architect in eCommerce at Evri. I’m passionate about building better software, improving developer experience, and making a positive impact in tech.

## What Developer Experience (DevEx) Means to Me

Driven by my interest in DevSecFinOps and Developer Experience, I spent years advocating for a dedicated Platform/DevEx team at Evri. When the squad was greenlit, I volunteered and was seconded, recognised by my peers as an expert in tools like Maven and Jenkins, and for having written the original pipeline library that our new one evolved from in May 2018. Our mission: improve the velocity and quality of code and feature delivery across the engineering function.

**Key Responsibilities & Achievements:**
- **Support & Mentorship:** Supported and mentored the Lead DevEx Engineer.
- **Research & Innovation:** Conducted research and shared ideas to improve developer experience.
- **Alignment & Strategy:** Ensured alignment with the Architecture team and prepared strategies, standards, and policies.
- **Tool Enhancements:** Introduced and enhanced tools like Mend Renovate for dependency management.
- **GitLab Settings Standardisation:** Implemented a nightly configuration standardisation process using GitLabForm.
- **Developer Portal:** Introduced a proof of concept internal developer portal using Backstage.
- **DevOps Tooling:** Helped automate maintenance of Jenkins and other tools.
- **Pipeline Enhancements:** Enhanced the Pipeline Library for Jenkins using Groovy, TypeScript, CDK, and Java. Key features included:
  - Identifying reference builds and associated commits using the Git Forensics plugin.
  - Quality gates against reference builds using Jenkins Warnings Next Generation & Git Forensics Plugins.
  - Commenting on merge requests for violating lines using the Violation Comments to GitLab Plugin.
  - Parsing warnings and creating standardised summary comments on merge requests.
  - Generating and aggregating SBOMs and publishing to Dependency Track.
  - Integrating with the AppDynamics API to publish deployment events.
  - Maintaining ~90% unit test coverage.
  - Publishing tags to GitLab projects during deployments.
  - Signing commits with GPG.
  - Adding badges to pipeline runs.
  - Creating several pipelines from scratch.

## My Role & What I Do

As a Senior Technical Architect, I design software systems and components, identify and prioritise technical debt, and help set and review standards, patterns, and policies. I’m always looking for ways to automate processes, consolidate sprawling software estates into fewer, strategically chosen solutions, and drive cost efficiencies. My focus is on continuous improvement—making things better for teams, businesses, and the wider community.

## How I Got Here

I originally wanted to design and build video games—it sounded fun! But after seeing the lack of jobs in that industry, I switched to general software roles after my degree. Since then, I’ve advanced through several companies and roles to where I am now, focusing on architecture and technical leadership.

## Projects & Achievements

A recent case study:  
As part of my architectural work at Evri, I led efforts to foster agility in software delivery. This included:
- Consolidating a vast software estate into fewer, strategically chosen platforms.
- Driving cost efficiencies through automation and standardisation.
- Introducing and evolving standards, patterns, and policies to support modern delivery practices.
- Identifying and prioritising technical debt, and working with teams to address it.
- Supporting the adoption of DevSecFinOps practices across engineering.

## Learning & Community

I attend conventions when possible, dedicate regular time to learning, and contribute to open source. Staying connected to the community and industry trends is important to me.

---

## What Motivates Me

A desire to do the right thing and leave a positive impact—on my industry, my colleagues, and the wider community—drives everything I do.

---

## Travel & Perspective

Travel has taught me that England and America aren’t the most advanced countries, despite what some might believe. The world is big and also tiny. Visiting places like Hong Kong’s airport (built on a reclaimed island) and their high-speed trains showed me what’s possible when countries invest in infrastructure. We’ve stagnated in many ways; travel is the best education you can get.

## Outside of Work

I love spending time with my wife and two boys, playing video games, and tackling carpentry and DIY projects (like remodelling our upstairs layout).

---

## Community & Advice

I’m active in the open source community (see my [GitHub](https://github.com/mortonl)).

My advice: **Remain skeptical but still try to drive improvement—don’t become part of the problem.**
