# Board Games

I'm passionate about modern board games, particularly quick-playing social games that work well with larger groups. My collection was largely shaped by years of office lunchtime gaming sessions, where we'd spend an hour playing multiple rounds of fast games or switching between different titles.

These lunchtime sessions taught me the value of games that are easy to learn, quick to play, and excellent icebreakers for new colleagues. There's something magical about watching someone who's never played board games before suddenly get competitive over a 15-minute game of **Coup** or laugh uncontrollably during **BANG!**

## Office Gaming Origins

For many years, our office had a thriving lunchtime board game culture. We'd gather around a table with whoever was free, pull out a quick game, and spend the hour playing multiple rounds or trying different games. It was the perfect way to decompress from work while getting to know colleagues from different departments.

These sessions were incredibly inclusive - from the shy apprentice to the senior manager, everyone could jump in and have fun. Games became a universal language that broke down workplace hierarchies and helped people connect who might never have interacted otherwise.

## Quick Social Games

My favorite type of board game is the 15-20 minute social experience that can handle 6+ players. These games proved perfect for our lunchtime format - quick to explain, fast to play, and always leaving people wanting "just one more round."

**Coup** is probably my most-played game in this category. It's a brilliant bluffing game where everyone has secret roles and you're trying to eliminate other players through deduction, lies, and well-timed challenges. The tension builds quickly, and games rarely last more than 15 minutes, making it perfect for multiple rounds.

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf** became another lunchtime favorite. Everyone closes their eyes, the werewolves wake up and choose a victim, then everyone debates who the werewolf is. The beauty is that it's literally one night - one round of discussion and voting, then you start fresh with new roles. Perfect for quick sessions.

**BANG!** and its expansions form a significant part of my collection. This wild west themed game creates fantastic storytelling moments as players take on roles of sheriffs, outlaws, and deputies in a hidden role shootout. The various expansions add new characters, events, and mechanics that keep the game fresh.

### Social Deduction Arsenal
**Salem 1692** brought witch trial drama to our lunch table. Players are either townspeople trying to survive or witches trying to avoid detection. The historical theme and accusation mechanics created incredibly tense moments as people pointed fingers and defended themselves.

**Good Cop Bad Cop** added a modern twist to hidden roles. Half the players are honest cops, half are crooked, and everyone's trying to figure out who's who while investigating each other. The equipment cards and action system made it feel more tactical than pure social deduction.

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** is another standout in my collection. One player is the murderer, another is the forensic scientist giving cryptic clues, and everyone else tries to solve the case. It's like being in a detective story where the clues are intentionally vague and everyone's a suspect.

**Avalon** rounds out my social deduction collection. It's all about hidden loyalties, secret missions, and trying to figure out who you can trust. The tension when someone proposes a quest team and you're trying to read everyone's reactions is incredible.

### Team Games
**Codenames** was perfect for when we had larger groups or wanted something less confrontational. Two teams compete to identify their agents using one-word clues. Watching someone give the clue "animal, 3" and seeing their teammates debate whether "bear" or "eagle" is the right answer created hilarious moments.

**Tortuga** brought pirate-themed team play to the table. Players are either British or French, but identities are hidden, and you're trying to control various aspects of the pirate ship while figuring out who's on your side.

## Beyond Lunchtime Gaming

While quick social games dominate my collection, I also have several favorites for longer gaming sessions:

### Strategic Depth
**Dominion** was my gateway into deck-building games. Starting with a basic deck and gradually adding more powerful cards creates a satisfying engine-building experience. The variety of kingdom cards means every game feels different.

**Unfair** takes the theme park building genre and adds a delicious layer of sabotage. You're building your own theme park while playing "unfair" cards to mess with your opponents. It perfectly captures the competitive business world with a sense of humor.

**Ticket to Ride** remains one of the best gateway strategy games ever made. Collecting train cards to claim railway routes across the map is simple to learn but offers genuine strategic decisions about risk and route planning.

### Classic Tile-Laying
**Carcassonne** with its various expansions provides endless tile-laying puzzle solving. Building the French countryside piece by piece while competing for control of cities, roads, and monasteries never gets old.

**CATAN** remains a classic for good reason. The trading, building, and resource management create a perfect balance of strategy and social interaction.

### Miniature Gaming
**Star Wars X-Wing** and **Armada** represent my foray into miniature gaming. X-Wing focuses on dogfighting with individual starfighters, while Armada brings massive capital ship battles to the table. Both capture the feel of Star Wars space combat perfectly, though they require significantly more time and setup than my usual games.

### Trading Card Games
**Magic: The Gathering** has been a constant throughout my gaming journey. While it's quite different from board games, the strategic depth and constant evolution of the game keeps drawing me back. Building decks and the psychological aspects of play create a completely different but equally engaging experience.

## The Perfect Lunchtime Game

Years of office gaming taught me what makes a truly great social game. The best lunchtime games had to:

- **Teach in 2 minutes** - New people could join mid-session
- **Play in 15 minutes** - Fit comfortably in a lunch break
- **Handle 6+ players** - Include everyone who wanted to play
- **Create instant connections** - Get people laughing and talking
- **Work for repeat plays** - Stay fresh over hundreds of games

## Collection Philosophy

My collection reflects this lunchtime gaming philosophy. Every game has been battle-tested in the crucible of office lunch breaks, where games either create genuine fun and connection or get abandoned after a few tries. The survivors in my collection are games that consistently brought people together, sparked conversations, and left everyone eager for the next session.

## Proven Icebreakers

The games in my collection have proven themselves as incredible social tools. I've watched **Coup** turn a table of strangers into a group of friends arguing about whether someone "looks like they have the Duke." **BANG!** has a magical ability to get the quietest person at the table suddenly shouting "I'm the Sheriff!" and dramatically pointing at people.

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** was particularly brilliant for mixed groups - watching a senior executive try to give cryptic clues about a murder weapon to a group of junior developers created some of the most memorable lunchtime moments.

**Codenames** had a unique ability to reveal how people think. Watching teammates try to connect seemingly unrelated words through creative clues led to both brilliant "aha!" moments and hilarious misunderstandings that had the whole table laughing.

These games don't just entertain - they're social catalysts. They give people permission to be silly, competitive, and creative in ways that normal workplace interaction doesn't allow.

## Building Workplace Connections

What made these lunchtime games so special was watching colleagues discover new sides of each other. The quiet developer who turned out to be a master bluffer in **Coup**. The serious manager who got completely into character during **BANG!**. The new hire who helped solve the murder in **Deception** on their first day.

These games created shared experiences and inside jokes that carried over into regular work. People who had never spoken before would reference a particularly memorable game or ask when the next session was happening. It built genuine friendships and made the workplace more collaborative and enjoyable.

The best lunchtime sessions weren't about who won or lost - they were about the laughter, the dramatic moments, and the connections formed over a simple card game. "Remember when Dave convinced everyone he was the Sheriff for the entire game?" or "I can't believe Sarah's clue 'round things, 4' actually worked in Codenames" became the kind of stories that got retold for months.

These games created a shared language and culture in our workplace that extended far beyond the lunch table, making every day a little more enjoyable and every colleague a little more like a friend.
