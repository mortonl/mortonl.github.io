### ðŸ“š Case Study: Enabling Agility Through Reuse
One of my most impactful projects was the **design of the Product Catalogue, Quoting, and Order Fulfillment system** at Evri. This architecture was foundational for multiple initiatives:

- Originally built to support new send flow features like **Evri Video** and **service speed differentiation**.
- Later reused in the **Post Office Reseller** and **Evri Website International** projects, saving **~6 months of development time** by leveraging existing services and databases.
- Demonstrated the power of **modular, reusable design** and **holistic architectural thinking**.

This case exemplifies how thoughtful architecture can **accelerate delivery**, **reduce costs**, and **enable strategic reuse** across business domains.

### ðŸ§© What I Tackle at Evri
My work spans a wide range of architectural responsibilities, including:

- **Creating and reviewing LLDs** for features like international quoting, invoice exclusions, and routing APIs.
- **Investigating and planning for future systems**, such as OAuth integrations, carrier management APIs, and premium delivery networks.
- **Driving architectural hygiene**, including component deprecation, drift detection, and tech debt remediation.
- **Leading Proof of Concepts (PoCs)** for tools like Moderne, Applitools, and OpenRewrite automation.
- **Improving developer experience**, from GitLab access models to Backstage enhancements and pipeline migrations.
- **Drift detection and remediation**: Implementing automated checks and enforcement for infrastructure drift.
- **Component deprecation processes**: Defining and piloting structured approaches to safely retire outdated components.
- **Weekly maintenance automation**: Proactively scheduling and rotating maintenance tasks to ensure system hygiene.
- **PCI DSS compliance**: Ensuring critical vulnerabilities are addressed within SLA, especially for payment-related systems.
- **DevSecOps mindset**: Embedding security into architecture and delivery, aligning with confidentiality, integrity, and availability principles.
- **Onboarding and documentation**: Contributing to onboarding guides, architectural standards, and documentation strategies.
- **Backstage improvements**: Enhancing internal developer portals and metadata syncs to improve discoverability and governance.
- **Tech debt triage and hygiene**: Defining what constitutes tech debt, advocating for its visibility, and aligning remediation with strategic goals.
- **Architecture board processes**: Contributing to the governance of architectural decisions and traceability of requirements.

I maintain a living backlog of architectural tasks, ideas, and investigations to ensure weâ€™re always improvingâ€”not just delivering.
